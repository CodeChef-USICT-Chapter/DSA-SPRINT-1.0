Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters.

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which read the same backwards and forwards.

Example:

If the input string happens to be, "malayalam" then as we see that this word can be read the same as forward and backwards, it is said to be a valid palindrome.
The expected output for this example will print, 'true'.
From that being said, you are required to return a boolean value from the function that has been asked to implement.

Sample Input 1 :
abcdcba

Sample Output 1 :
true

Sample Input 2:
coding

Sample Output 2:
false
