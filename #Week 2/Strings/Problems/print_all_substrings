For a given input string(str), write a function to print all the possible substrings.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
Example: "spr" is a substring of "sprint". Whereas, "pint" is not as the characters taken are not contiguous

Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.

Output Format:
Print the total number of substrings possible, where every substring is printed on a single line and hence,
the total number of output lines will be equal to the total number of substrings.

Sample Input 1:
dsa
Sample Output 1:
d
ds
dsa

 Sample Input 2:
